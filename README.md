# retro-maze-3d

A 2d maze generator with 3d walk thru

The initial version of this app, is written using javascript, yes, not exactly a retro language.  However, the technics used to draw both the 2d and 3d views, use methods commonly used in retro systems.  Back in 1981, a month after buying my first computer, a TRS-80 Model 1, I created a 2d grid style maze generator, followed shortly by a 3d view.  This was all done in the level 2 basic.  I was inspired by a magazine article with a listing of a maze generator for a maze using hexagonal cells.  Once familiar with the algorithm, I built my own version using a grid style.

The code could use a bit of cleanup and restructuring, but it works, so may get to this one day.
